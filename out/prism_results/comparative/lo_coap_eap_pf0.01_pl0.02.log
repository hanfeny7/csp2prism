Warning: Update 2 of command 1 of module "ChanDS" doesn't do anything (line 78, column 29)

Error: Probabilities in command 1 of module "ChanDS" sum to less than one (e.g. 0.9902) for some states. Perhaps some of the updates give out-of-range values. One possible solution is to strengthen the guard (line 76, column 3).

Warning: CUDD reports 3705 non-zero references.
